          <p>Two-Spirit people in the U.S., or Indigenous Americans who identify themselves beyond binary understandings of gender, face discrimination and respond with resistance. ‘Two-Spirit’ is a general term used to describe a variety of third-gender roles in Native American cultures. It comes from the idea that Two-Spirits have both masculine and feminine spirits. However, Two-Spirit identities have much variety, encompassing different sexualities and gender identities.</p>

          <p>Historically, Two-Spirits had specific, often ritual roles in their communities. Many tribes valued them highly as spiritual leaders. However, in some cultures, Two-Spirits may have been less enthusiastically accepted. Colonization only caused difficulties for these individuals, who did not fit the Western frame of gender. At the same time, their Tribes began to lose connection with parts of their cultures, including the historical roles of Two-Spirits. Because of this, Two-Spirits not only face racism and gender discrimination from White Americans, but also struggle to find acceptance in the wider Native American community. Many Indigenous Americans consider queerness to be a white concept, making Two-Spirits, in their eyes, not truly Native. At the same time, the idea that queerness is white excludes Two-Spirits from the LGBTQ+ community. Because of this double bind, the Gay American Indians and later Two-Spirit movements were created as spaces for community and activism.</a>. <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--></p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
