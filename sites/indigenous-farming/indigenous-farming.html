		      <hr>
            <p>Though farming practices are not one-size-fits-all across every Indigenous community, Indigenous agriculture is often deeply intertwined with respect for the land one gathers resources from, connection to the food that is eaten, and overall sustainability.</p>

            <p>When discussing Indigenous farming practices, it is important to understand that Western agricultural systems are a product of colonialism. Graddy-Lovelace (2017) notes that capitalist racial hierarchies in US agricultural history have erased the systems of small-scale farmers, including Indigenous farmers. Western agricultural systems have commodified and mass-produced foods, effectively disconnecting most people from what they eat and where it was grown. The mutual respect for our food and our Earth, as it is emphasized in many Indigenous food systems and lifeways, is lacking.</p>

        <h3>Examples of Indigenous Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
          <hr>
            <p> The Zuni in the southwest USA, as outlined by Sandor et al. (2002), have maintained runoff agricultural fields for generations – they are some of the oldest in the entire country. The Zuni have a system which identifies twelve major soil types, differentiated on the basis of color, texture, and consistency. As highlighted in the article, “these terms contain meaning beyond describing discrete material. They incorporate knowledge of soil material and agronomic properties, coupled with awareness of geomorphic and ecological processes that create and distribute earth materials". This knowledge, compounded and refined over many years, enables the Zuni to “recycle” precious agricultural resources in arid climates.</p>
	          <p> Another example of sustainable practices in Indigenous knowledge comes from Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass, which outlined a research project about Indigenous cultivation and harvesting of sweetgrass. It was found – to the shock of Western academics but not to the Potawotami Elders offering their guidance on the project – that sweetgrass has a special relationship to humans, relying on us for cultivation and thriving when harvested, whereas untouched or uncultivated sweetgrass dies. Sustainable harvesting practices have been a core tenet of Indigenous knowledge for millennia – as Kimmerer wrote, “If we use a plant respectfully it will stay with us and flourish. If we ignore it, it will go away” (Kimmerer, 2013). Even connection to sweetgrass, however, has been threatened; as highlighted by Schmitt (2021), Wabanaki families in the Acadia region have been prohibited from harvesting sweetgrass in the boundaries of Acadia National Park - land that encompasses their traditional territory. This, again, highlights the colonially-enforced disconnect from agricultural products.</p>
            <p> Finally, one cannot speak about sustainable Indigenous agricultural practices without discussing the Three Sisters Planting methods, wherein squash, corn, and beans are grown together in the same plot of Earth. This method uses up less land for agriculture, promotes soil fertility, and fosters a connection between the food being grown and the person growing it.  An informational video on this specific method can be found below. </p>
            <p> Ultimately, these examples of Indigenous agricultural practices demonstrate both the rich scope of Indigenous ecological knowledge and their practical applications towards a more sustainable future. Implemenation of Indigenous sustainable agriculture has the potential to restore both relationships to land and connections to our food, both of which have been severed by coloniality. Revitalization of traditional agricultural practices - and by extension, self-determination over ideology surrounding them - is therefore an important aspect of Indigenous Food Sovereignty.</p>
