          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>Human-built mounds and other earthworks - like those that comprise the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks complex in present-day central Ohio - are sacred and culturally crucial sites that hold great importance for Native American individuals and groups, many of whom are limited or blocked from using and enjoying the sites in the ways they are intended to be used. Due to various political, economic, and social factors, many of these earthworks have been irreparably damaged or destroyed during periods of “exploration” and “development,” or are now considered the legal possessions and responsibility of the landowners whose property lines contain the sites. This project will use a perspective that relies on the recent widespread embrace of ideas like cultural ownership and object repatriation that now hold museums and similar institutions accountable for supporting and upholding the ethical gathering and sharing of knowledge. This viewpoint will be used to argue that the reasoning and beliefs backing the return of funerary and other sacred items to Indigenous nations can - and should - also be applied to the idea of unhindered and easy access to religious and culturally crucial sites.</big>

          <hr>
          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>Human-built earthworks associated with burial and other ceremonial contexts that were constructed by various Indigenous groups during a 5,000 year period extending from around 3500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. were once numerous across what is now the Eastern United States. While there are now only a fraction remaining compared to what once existed, these sites endure (albeit in various degrees of care) as visually poignant reminders of the past as well as crucial foundational aspects that help anchor Indigenous groups and cultures within contemporary American society. Given their breadth of importance, the preservation of Native American earthworks as well as ease of access to these sites for Indigenous individuals and groups is imperative. By considering examples where locales that hold significance for Native North Americans have been successfully protected and stewarded in a manner that promotes Indigenous groups using them in ways that are considerate and culturally appropriate, the feasibility of securing widespread access and availability to these sites is evident.</big></p>

          <h3 style="font-family: Gill Sans"><b>Legal Groundwork</b></h3>
          <hr>
          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"> <big>Although U.S. legal systems and governance have a questionable, tense history regarding the recognition and protection of Indigenous culture, recent events suggest that the courtroom may now be one of the most efficient and successful settings in which Indigenous people can advocate for their rights and achieve the desired outcome, although this development retains its own issues. In 2022, the Ohio History Connection was successful in its years-long legal bid to take over the state’s lease with a Newark country club that ran a golf course located over the Octagon Earthworks complex that the historical society wished to reclaim control over. <a href="https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/53992/PDF/1/play/" rel="citation" data-content="Court sides with history society’s access to earthworks - ICT News
rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/53992/PDF/1/play/

">[Welsh-Huggins & Smyth]</a> However, the process was complex and lengthy, with the OHC first having to prove to the state Supreme Court that they had followed all of the legal requirements and expectations involved with a letting contract in Ohio. They also had to prove that the Moundbuilders Country Club had not fulfilled the public accessibility terms of their 2003 agreement to justify and win their claim. It is evident that these attractive endings only occur when the law is already leaning in Indigenous groups’ favor as it was written and when all involved parties meet the requirements that the United States and its entities set forth. There is not such an appealing conclusion to these proceedings when Indigenous existence contradicts or doesn’t conform to the expectations of U.S. culture and history.</big></p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
