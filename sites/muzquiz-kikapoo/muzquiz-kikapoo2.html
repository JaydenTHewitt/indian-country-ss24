          <p>In the United States, the majority of conversations concerning Indigenous nations focus on those living within U.S. borders. 
            However, as colonization pushed westward, the displacement of Indigenous Nations, through events such as the Trail of Tears and disrespected treaties, separated Nations from their point of origin. 
            The Kickapoo (Kikapú in the Spanish spelling) were subject to this intense displacement as their roots planted around the Great Lakes were pulled and forced south just past the Mexican border. 
            Different factions of the Kickapoo stayed in the United states due to treaties made with the US government while others went to Mexico in search of land and opportunities. </p>

            <p>The Kickapoo have their origins in the Great Lake region of lower Michigan. 
              They are considered to be a part of the Algonquian linguistic lineage whose territory originally bordered on east and north by the great lakes and on the west by the Mississippi River. 
              At the beginning of colonization they had complicated relations with the French which set the stage for duplicity on the side of the young United States. 
              The broken promises made by several nations led to the major displacement of the Kickapoo from what is now Michigan to an area close to Muzquiz, Coahuila Mexico. 
              As a result of this intense displacement the Kickapoo have been subject to conflict with sovereignty, healthcare, and legal recognition by the Mexican and US government. 
              These difficulties affect not only the Kickapoo but all indigenous people separated by these new foreign borders. <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“History of the Mexican Kickapoo.” Milwaukee Public Museum.

    <h3>Land Sovereignty</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>For Indigenous communities the topic of ‘Sovereignty’ is one of continuously heated debate.
    There is a solid claim to be made on the lands Native Americans had occupied since long before the colonization of the Americas began. When these communities have a verified connection for the land they fight to maintain, there is a stronger sense of sovereignty
    over that land, both recognized by the tribe and the foreign powers surrounding it. It is this fight for sovereignty and recognition of said sovereignty that is seen throughout the United States. But what can be said for tribes who populate land of which they had
    no ancestral claim to? For transnational tribes, such as the Muzquiz-Kickapoo, there can be a more complicated connection to the land and the nation they live on. </p>

    <p>The journey from the Great Lakes of Michigan to Muzquiz Coahuila Mexico is long in both distance
    and duration. Via European records, observation of Kickapoo habitation of the Great Lakes is dated as early as the 1600’s (Schulze 35). Combining the fact that the Kickapoo gained Mexican land plots in the 1840’s, you are left with nearly 250 years of migration.
    The first trek was to Wisconsin in 1654 due to hostility between neighboring tribes (Schulze 35), and later to Illinois (Goggin 314). It is around the 1800’s when the formation, as well as terminations, of treaties were commonplace. It was the creation and alterations
    of certain treaties that led to the movement to Missouri in 1819, and Kansas in 1932. Lower and lower the Kickapoo were slowly getting pushed until they eventually made their way to texas, which was at the time the Mexican Province of Texas.</p>
    <p>Circling back to the question
    of sovereignty, why were the Kickapoo given land from a nation of which they had no ancestral roots? It isn’t so much a question of whether or not the Kickapoo hold a claim over Mexican land, but rather what is there to gain (by both parties) from a partnership between the Kickapoo
    and the Mexican government. It was this cost and gain mentality that led the Mexican government to offer land in Texas in exchange for defending the borders from hostile tribes (Goggin 315). This relationship prospered until 1838, when Texas was eventually annexed into a U.S.
    state, and the Kickapoo went from being Mexico inhabitants to America inhabitants. It was due to this, as well as the newly placed 1839 Indian Removal Policy made by Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar, that the Kickapoo were forced to once again flee southward past the border.
    They were once again granted access to land in exchange for loyalty and border defense by the Mexican government in 1848.</p>

    <h3>Identity</h3>
    <hr> <!--This prints a line under the title-->
    <p> Being a transnational indigenous nation can lead to internal conflict regarding one’s cultural identity. The dynamic nature of culture leaves it vulnerable to outside influences especially if the people are made to adapt and assimilate to certain cultures in order to prosper socially and economically. The more a culture changes the more they can take advantage of the adopted culture and vice versa. The economic benefits that the United States offers has led the Kickapoo to seek work there. Since Mexico does not offer the same level of economic promise the Kickapoo are not as dependent on it leading to the culture integrating more US qualities than Mexican.</p>
    <p> As a result, the dressing style and language patterns of the youth have adopted characteristics of the US. The trend among the younger generation of speaking English instead of Spanish or the traditional Kickapoo language has raised concern among the elders about the future authenticity of Kickapoo culture. This trend arises mainly due to able bodied workers living and working outside of El Nacimiento. People often leave El Nacimiento with their families to work in seasonal agricultural jobs or move closer to the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino in Texas and are rarely in El Nacimiento. </p>
    <p> Having somewhere one can call home helps keep people grounded and gives them access to their community and culture. With the drastic displacement transnational Indigenous Nations have faced the importance placed upon the site of El Nacimiento as their main cultural center is imperative to keeping the culture alive. In an effort to connect with their culture, El Nacimiento is treated as a cultural retreat where people go to visit during weekends, vacations, and religious celebrations. Most Elderly members of the Kickapoo prefer to stay in El Nacimiento and share their knowledge there. Cultural identity cannot stay static for long, the conscious effort people make to pass down the traditions is crucial to keeping the culture alive and feeling connected to their roots. In El Nacimiento the Kickapoo are able to practice their ceremonies and implement traditions into daily life passing on the knowledge onto future generations.</p>
