          <p>The Land Back Movement is a movement that has existed for generations and intends to reestablish Indigenous sovereignty and return the land to Indigenous hands (Landback). This movement has acted as a way to spark recognition, reparation, and action in reclaiming lands that were originally Indigenous. However the campaign is more than just a fight for indigenous sovereignty, it has been described as “incorporating all dimensions of the right to be self-determining.” (DeLancey, 178). According to the Landback website, this includes the reclamation of things other than land such as “language, ceremony, food, education, housing, healthcare, governance, medicine, and kinship”.</p>

          <p>
              <p> </p>There has been a recent resurgence of this historical movement in 2020, amidst rallies to return Mount Rushmore on the Black Hills mountain range in South Dakota to its original inhabitants, The Sioux or Oceti Sakowin tribe. (Pieratos et al., 51). This recent event helped to bring about the trending hashtag on social media in the Fall of 2021, #LANDBACK, which social media users would display as a demonstration of solidarity with Indigenous activists (Staherski, 4). The 2020 protest along with the trending social media displays of unification have created a new resurgence of the land back rhetoric that has helped to reshape the movement into a contemporary adaptation. According to the LandBack website, the campaign is not controlled or owned by any single group or organization and the framework encourages all to imagine a world where Black, Indigenous, and people of color liberation can co-exist. The modern movement persists in many areas of the United States and continues to be a framework that aims to address and dismantle White Supremacy and colonialism through different gatherings, rallies, protests, and legal battles.

          <h3>LandBack Manifesto</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> <ul>It is a relationship with Mother Earth that is symbiotic and just, where we have reclaimed stewardship.
It is bringing our People with us as we move towards liberation and embodied sovereignty through an organizing, political and narrative framework.
It is a long legacy of warriors and leaders who sacrificed freedom and life.
It is a catalyst for current generation organizers and centers the voices of those who represent our future.
It is recognizing that our struggle is interconnected with the struggles of all oppressed Peoples.
It is a future where Black reparations and Indigenous LANDBACK co-exist. Where BIPOC collective liberation is at the core.
It is acknowledging that only when Mother Earth is well, can we, her children, be well. It is our belonging to the land – because – we are the land.
We are LANDBACK!</ul>

          <p> There are many useful things that you can do in HTML, and here we will provide a list of some things that may be useful for creating your site:</p>
            <ul> <!-- This creates an "unorderd list", or basically bullet points. Use <ol> if you want an "ordered", or numbered list (and don't forget to close it!). -->
              <li>You can also create regular links to things without pop-over content. For example, <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki">this link</a> goes to the Indian Country Wiki. You may also make links open up in a new tab by adding the target attribute with the the blank value: <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki" target="blank">same link, but it opens in a new tab</a></li> <!-- Just replace the href url with your desired url, and the normal text("this link") for your link -->
              <li>You may also create <a href="#jump">links that jump to other parts of the page</a> by putting an id in the element you want to jump to (see the <u>Image Sources</u> heading below to see where to put the id), and then doing #id in the href.<!-- Each id must be unique to jump to it --></li>
              <li>You may also format your text in an number of ways, including by: <b>bolding</b>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphaszing</em>, <u>underlining</u> or by designating <strong>strong text</strong></li>
            </ul>
          <p> For ideas on what else is possible with HTML, you can check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a>, or ask your graduate assistant for some feedback on what you want to do with your essay.</p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9PWzcdfiD4?si=F34Qg4fr2xKN-kHu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
