          <p>The Land Back Movement is a movement that has existed for generations and intends to reestablish Indigenous sovereignty and return the land to Indigenous hands (Landback). This movement has acted as a way to spark recognition, reparation, and action in reclaiming lands that were originally Indigenous. However the campaign is more than just a fight for indigenous sovereignty, it has been described as “incorporating all dimensions of the right to be self-determining.” (DeLancey, 178). According to the Landback website, this includes the reclamation of things other than land such as “language, ceremony, food, education, housing, healthcare, governance, medicine, and kinship”.</p>

              <p> </p>There has been a recent resurgence of this historical movement in 2020, amidst rallies to return Mount Rushmore on the Black Hills mountain range in South Dakota to its original inhabitants, The Sioux or Oceti Sakowin tribe.<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Pieratos, Nikki A, et al. “Land back: A meta narrative to help indigenous people show up as movement leaders.” Leadership, vol. 17, no. 1, 8 Dec. 2020, p. 51, https://doi.org/10.1177/1742715020976204.">(Pieratos et al., 51)</a>. This recent event helped to bring about the trending hashtag on social media in the Fall of 2021, #LANDBACK, which social media users would display as a demonstration of solidarity with Indigenous activists (Staherski, 4). The 2020 protest along with the trending social media displays of unification have created a new resurgence of the land back rhetoric that has helped to reshape the movement into a contemporary adaptation. According to the LandBack website, the campaign is not controlled or owned by any single group or organization and the framework encourages all to imagine a world where Black, Indigenous, and people of color liberation can co-exist. The modern movement persists in many areas of the United States and continues to be a framework that aims to address and dismantle White Supremacy and colonialism through different gatherings, rallies, protests, and legal battles.

            <ul>
              <li>It is a relationship with Mother Earth that is symbiotic and just, where we have reclaimed stewardship.</li>
              <li>It is bringing our People with us as we move towards liberation and embodied sovereignty through an organizing, political and narrative framework.</li>
              <li>It is a long legacy of warriors and leaders who sacrificed freedom and life.</li>
<li>It is a catalyst for current generation organizers and centers the voices of those who represent our future.</li>
<li>It is recognizing that our struggle is interconnected with the struggles of all oppressed Peoples.</li>
<li>It is a future where Black reparations and Indigenous LANDBACK co-exist. Where BIPOC collective liberation is at the core.</li>
<li>It is acknowledging that only when Mother Earth is well, can we, her children, be well. It is our belonging to the land – because – we are the land.</li>
<b>We are LANDBACK!</b></ul>

          <p> There are many useful things that you can do in HTML, and here we will provide a list of some things that may be useful for creating your site:</p>
            <ul> <!-- This creates an "unorderd list", or basically bullet points. Use <ol> if you want an "ordered", or numbered list (and don't forget to close it!). -->
              <li>You can also create regular links to things without pop-over content. For example, <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki">this link</a> goes to the Indian Country Wiki. You may also make links open up in a new tab by adding the target attribute with the the blank value: <a href="https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki" target="blank">same link, but it opens in a new tab</a></li> <!-- Just replace the href url with your desired url, and the normal text("this link") for your link -->
              <li>You may also create <a href="#jump">links that jump to other parts of the page</a> by putting an id in the element you want to jump to (see the <u>Image Sources</u> heading below to see where to put the id), and then doing #id in the href.<!-- Each id must be unique to jump to it --></li>
              <li>You may also format your text in an number of ways, including by: <b>bolding</b>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphaszing</em>, <u>underlining</u> or by designating <strong>strong text</strong></li>
            </ul>

        <hr>
          <p> Since the mid-to-late 2010s, the Indigenous communities of Minnesota have continued to exemplify the tenets of Land Back by recovering land stolen from them, forcing universities, administrations, and corporations to honor treaties, and healing cultural wounds that have resulted from land theft. The importance of this land cannot be overstated, as many Indigenous people continue to rely on forests and waterways as food sources and a source of cultural awareness and tradition keeping. Bands recovering this land is more than mere ownership, as Bois Forte Band Chairwoman Cathy Chavers explains, “[the] land is our identity. Without it, we are lost”.

            <p> The case of the University of Minnesota is an especially contentious one, especially as many similar debates and reclamations are happening within other land grant universities around the country (Michigan State being one of them). The Minnesota Indian Affairs Council’s TRUTH report laid bare the extent of violence, thievery, and treaty disregard committed by Minnesota and many other land grant universities, in turn. The TRUTH project is the “first of its kind” in the United States, offering an opportunity for a federal land grant university to truly reckon with its mistreatment and oppression of Indigenous peoples

The report, created in collaboration with both Sioux and Ojibwe bands across Minnesota, found that the University of Minnesota had “committed genocide and ethnic cleansing of Indigenous peoples for financial gain”, an admission of guilt that most other universities have not adequately addressed <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“TRUTH Project.” Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, University of Minnesota, Mar. 2023, mn.gov/indian-affairs/truth-project/.">(TRUTH 2023)</a>. </p>
