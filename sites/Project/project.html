          <p>The practice of collecting sweet grass, bird feathers, and pine leaves are core to the religious practices of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The government has gone as far as fencing off large areas of their lands including a traditionally sacred pass through the desert to the southern territories they possess. This is a huge infringement on the religious freedoms of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The tribe has taken to cutting the wire fences themselves to access their lands, as their proposed solutions such as the “Tohono O’odham Citizenship Act of 2013” was proposed and failed to pass in Congress. Many prominent members of the nation have come out and have stated they would protest the development of a border wall as those at Standing Rock defended their land and Vice Chairperson Verlon Jose has asserted that it will be built “over [his] dead body”.

              <p>Developmental projects exist in a multitude of ways, such as roads, mines, walls, and factories. Projects are done to provide aid for the community they are being built in. The result of most developmental projects, however, is the opposite of what would be counted as helping. The Tohono O’odham has a history of a major developmental project pushed by the US government with the wall’s construction. This wall has existed in many forms since the early 20th century, with the first instance of its creation being a barbed wire fence in 1909 only covering a small area. The wall is currently being built under the Biden administration with the precedent set by the Trump administration and is resulting in many environmental issues. The most notable being plant and animal endangerment and the division of tribal lands.</p> 
              <p>Developmental projects exist around the world as well, such as the lead and lignite mines in Thailand. Both have resulted in the destruction of native lands with pollution and habitat destruction. The Thailand mines are an example of how developmental projects are designed to benefit the organization and government. Additionally, the border conflict showcases another fact that comes with developmental projects. That being they are not done with the acknowledgement of the people they will impact. The Tohono O’odham tribe will be divided due to the wall, as the US and Mexico did not factor in the existence of people on the border.</p>
              <p>According to the BBC, the Tohono O'odham Nation was never consulted on the destruction of burial sites in effort to make way for the construction of the Oregon Pipeline in Arizona. This disrespect shown to the Tohono O’odham by the US government is justified by laws instilling that US National Security law supersedes pre-existing treaties with tribes to respect their sovereignty over their own lands. It allows the US government a “Trump” card to utilize any land north of the border for any purpose if they can justify the development’s utility as a security measure. (BBC, Feb 2020) </p>
