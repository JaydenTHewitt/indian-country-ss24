            <p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;">Border crossing has been a point of contention between Tohono O’odham Nation, the United States, and Mexico, and continues to be an issue today. Because the Tohono O’odham Nation has lands that span over the Mexican-American border, they are forced to present identification documents at the points of crossing and are not able to freely move within their own lands. This raises the question of which kind of identification can be used and how? United States citizens present U.S. Passports or Enhanced State Driver’s License when crossing the border by land, but Tohono O’odham people are not U.S. citizens as they are a sovereign nation. The Enhanced Tribal Identification Cards (ETCs) were a solution created with the US government for sovereign nations within the United States like the Tohono O’odham Nation to cross into their Mexican Lands and return to the United States. This is a modern solution to a modern problem regarding border crossing, that the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua reserved the rights for Indigenous Nations who were separated from their lands and people by  new borders caused by the American war for Independence.  This treaty has been violated innumerable times since its inception, creating problems such as these for the Tohono O’odham Nation. (Leza, 2024)</p>
            <p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;">The Tohono O’odham are unable to travel freely across the border. They should be allowed as they were given the ability in the past with the existence of gates that they are able to pass through. International rights exist for indigenous communities, for example with the UNDRI, which grants them the ability to travel across borders to cultural lands and natural resources. The Jay Treaty of 1794 is a treaty that exists to allow travel across the US-Canadian border. (Livesay & Saltzman, 2019)</p>

          <p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 20px;">Travel to religious sites is a protected right for tribes located along the border with the creation of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. This is heavily restricted with the further cementation of the border alongside strict regulation on identification laws along the border. The US government is given the ability to waive any US law to enforce the use of identification since 2005 with the Real ID Act (Scheidel et al., 2023). For example, the practice of collecting sweet grass, bird feathers, and pine leaves are core to the religious practices of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The government has gone as far as fencing off large areas of their lands including a traditionally sacred pass through the desert to the southern territories they possess. This is a huge infringement on the religious freedoms of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The tribe has taken to cutting the wire fences themselves to access their lands, as their proposed solutions such as the “Tohono O’odham Citizenship Act of 2013” was proposed and failed to pass in Congress. Many prominent members of the nation have come out and have stated they would protest the development of a border wall as those at Standing Rock defended their land and Vice Chairperson Verlon Jose has asserted that it will be built “over [his] dead body”.

          <h3>United States vs Mexican Perspective of the Tribe</h3>
          <hr>
            <p>The border acts as a display of the imbalance of power existing between the countries of US and Mexico, with one being a well-developed country and the other being an underdeveloped one in comparison. The tribes associated with the conflict of the border, most notably the Tohono O’odham, are most susceptible to the impact on the human condition which feeds into the imbalance of power. The US has the most say in what will happen to the tribe. Even if the Tohono O'odham fate was in Mexico’s hands, it would face issue with tribes not being viewed as sovereign states within the country and are thus susceptible to the regulations of the state (Alvarez, 1995). </p>

              <p>Developmental projects exist in a multitude of ways, such as roads, mines, walls, and factories. Projects are done to provide aid for the community they are being built in. The result of most developmental projects, however, is the opposite of what would be counted as helping. The Tohono O’odham has a history of a major developmental project pushed by the US government with the wall’s construction. This wall has existed in many forms since the early 20th century, with the first instance of its creation being a barbed wire fence in 1909 only covering a small area. The wall is currently being built under the Biden administration with the precedent set by the Trump administration and is resulting in many environmental issues. The most notable being plant and animal endangerment and the division of tribal lands.</p> 
              <p>Developmental projects exist around the world as well, such as the lead and lignite mines in Thailand. Both have resulted in the destruction of native lands with pollution and habitat destruction. The Thailand mines are an example of how developmental projects are designed to benefit the organization and government. Additionally, the border conflict showcases another fact that comes with developmental projects. That being they are not done with the acknowledgement of the people they will impact. The Tohono O’odham tribe will be divided due to the wall, as the US and Mexico did not factor in the existence of people on the border.</p>
              <p>According to the BBC, the Tohono O'odham Nation was never consulted on the destruction of burial sites in effort to make way for the construction of the Oregon Pipeline in Arizona. This disrespect shown to the Tohono O’odham by the US government is justified by laws instilling that US National Security law supersedes pre-existing treaties with tribes to respect their sovereignty over their own lands. It allows the US government a “Trump” card to utilize any land north of the border for any purpose if they can justify the development’s utility as a security measure. (BBC, Feb 2020) </p>
