          <p> In 1738 a French trader named Sieur de la Vérendrye came across an Indigenous Tribe called the Mandan.  This would become the first known account of the tribe.  He would go on to describe them as being in full power and prosperity, and they spoke the Siouan language.  During the peak of the tribe, they lived in 6 large villages near Heart River in North Dakota.  The lodges they lived in were dome-shaped and in the traditional villages there would be 12 to 100 or more of these earth lodges.  Each Village had 3 chiefs: one for war, peace, and a day-to-day village leader.  The Mandan raised corn, beans, pumpkins, sunflowers, and tobacco.  They also hunted buffalo and were good fishers.  Mandan community members would also make pottery, baskets, and painted buffalo robes that depicted the heroic deeds of the tribe and of individuals.     <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="https://www.mhanation.com/history">(MHA NATION 2018)</a> </p>
          <br><!--this creates a break, Which is great for creating space in a variety of situations. Note that this is the only way to add a line break into your HTML. Adding a blank line will not translate to more spacing. -->
          <p> In the 17th Century is when everything began to change for the Mandan tribes.  European settlers started to bring in smallpox.  Smallpox was a serious infectious disease caused by the variola virus and it was highly contagious.  Most people would go on to recover from the disease, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/index.html">(cdc)</a></p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
